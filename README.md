phase4word

An ideal competition

Welcome to phase4word. This is the first alpha version of phase4word.
I wish to bring this out in the open after 27 months of stealth so that I may invite my friends to test it in TestFlight.

The code is not yet well documented. I'm just learning programming, and it's a ton of work to build a whole functional ecosystem. Thus far, I have done my best to "hack" it together. There are so many ideas that I'm still incubating, from an introduction system that connects people based on discursive compatibility, to support of audio in addition to text (but no imagery), to being able to change your location to anywhere, to alternative player interfaces, and an extensible API for developers to build their own functionality and automation into the green ♻️economy.

I will also use this as the base repo from which to build phase4 as a global, open source, social development community.
