#### phase4word

The Swift code in this repository compiles into the version of phase4word that is currently in [early testing](https://phase4word.webnode.com). The [backend](https://github.com/KandorApp/ipfs-endpoint) is also open source.

phase4 is the codename for ßloc∫tar. Before there was ßloc∫tar, there was phase4. Before phase4, I had the idea to make an app called Kandor. In the summer of 2015, I was not a coder. ßut I had an idea to make a new kind of online forum, where ideas matter over identities. Such a system could allow for the fair evaluation of ideas. I am of course inspired by the philosopher John Stewart Mill, who considered such ideals as a "veil of ignorance" and a "marketplace of ideas". 

Originally, this repo called phase4word "An ideal competition". I mean a competition of ideals, a battle royale for thoughts. An online forum where each post, called a _Note_ has a value of ♻️green associated with it. We are used to systems in which the users are scored by their contributions. In ßloc∫tar née phase4, information has value, but there is no central ranking of users.

I invite you all to my TestFlight group to test phase4word, but I warn you that I think of this version of my software as more of a test system than a good demonstration or launch. There is very little documentation of the code, or instructions inside the app. phase4word is not a viable consumer experience, and the ♻️green is not yet persistent.

Since I began alpha testing in mid May, I took a break from active development of phase4. I took a job that I have since quit, but now I am now ready to advance my dreams.
